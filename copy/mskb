Producing .com Files With MASM
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/24954/en-us

MASM version 6.0 is the first version of the assembler to support the tiny model.
Use the following steps the produce a .com file in MASM 6.0.

1. Use .model tiny. Declare logical segments using the simplified segment directives
or full segment declarations.

-or-

Do not use the .model directive and assemble with /AT. Use full segment declarations.

2. Make sure that the first statement in the the code segment is ORG 100h.
3. Build the .com file.

Compiling and linking in one step:
If .model tiny was used, no options are needed. The linker will automatically receive
the /TINY switch, the file extension on the file produced will be .com, and the
executable is indeed a .com file.

-or-

Performing a separate link: Specify the /TINY option on the link command line. The
linker will issue the following harmless warning
L4045: name of output file is 'filename'
where 'filename' will have a .com extension.
