int21h/ah0 - DOS 1+ - TERMINATE PROGRAM
http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-2551.htm
Entry: CS = PSP segment
Notes: Microsoft recommends using INT 21/AH=4Ch for DOS 2+. This function sets the program's
return code (ERRORLEVEL) to 00h. Execution continues at the address stored in INT 22 after
DOS performs whatever cleanup it needs to do (restoring the INT 22,INT 23,INT 24 vectors from the
PSP assumed to be located at offset 0000h in the segment indicated by the stack copy of CS, etc.).
If the PSP is its own parent, the process's memory is not freed; if INT 22 additionally points into
the terminating program, the process is effectively NOT terminated.
Not supported by MS Windows 3.0 DOSX.EXE DOS extender

int21h/ah2 - WRITE CHARACTER TO STANDARD OUTPUT
Entry: DL = character to write
Return: AL = last character output
Notes:
    ^C/^Break are checked
    the last character output will be the character in DL unless DL=09h on entry, in which case AL=20h as tabs are expanded to blanks
    if standard output is redirected to a file, no error checks (write- protected, full media, etc.) are performed

int21h/ah9
Entry: DS:DX -> '$'-terminated string
Return: AL = 24h

int21h/ah4ch - "EXIT" - TERMINATE WITH RETURN CODE
Entry: AL = return code
Return: never returns
Notes: unless the process is its own parent, all open files are closed and all memory belonging to the process is freed
mov ax, 4c00h; int 21h 就是 return 0
