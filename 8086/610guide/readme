文章没有解释的概念 - 这篇炼金术士风格的文章有很多似是而非的概念

- module

就是源文件

证据: The END statement ... It must be at the end of every module.

- Assembler Directives

https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E28388/eoiyg.html
Directives are commands that are part of the assembler syntax but are not related to the x86 processor instruction set.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Language_design
Assembly directives, also called pseudo-opcodes, pseudo-operations or pseudo-ops, are commands given to an assembler
"directing it to perform operations other than assembling instructions.". Directives affect how the assembler operates
and "may affect the object code, the symbol table, the listing file, and the values of internal assembler parameters."
Sometimes the term pseudo-opcode is reserved for directives that generate object code, such as those that generate data.
